# CS50-tf-material
My teaching material for the section I teach in CS50. 

In the fall of 2016, I am a Teaching Fellow for the Harvard intro to computer science course, CS50. These are the notes that I give out each week as LaTeX files.

Included are both the LaTeX files for the week and also the subsequent pdf it produces. The content from the files is taken from different CS50 sources, including study.cs50.net, Doug's notes, TF's lesson plan notes, general internet, etc.

The Template for the LaTeX file was created by a friend who teaches CS51 (Tim).
