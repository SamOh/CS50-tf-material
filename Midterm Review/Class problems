Steps to break the problem down.

1. Psuedocode!
  + What is is that you are trying to do?
  + Can you write it out in words?

2. Make sure to include checks!
  + Especially if the question itself asks you to check for NULL, use it as a hint!

3. Pay Attention to key words!
  + "own block of dynamically allocated memory" â€“ You will want to use malloc

4. Translate the pseudocode
  + This is the easiest part, once you have the logic down, just translate it into C!

5. Look at lecture notes
  + you have access to them, so use them.
